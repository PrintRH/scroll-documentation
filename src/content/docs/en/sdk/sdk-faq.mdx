## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### How long is finality on Scroll chain?

Finality depends on the parameterization of how often your chain wants to finalize to Ethereum. Roughly, a batch is created every minute (containing ~20 blocks or 200 txs), and takes about 50 minutes to finalize on L1.

Our next upgrade with increase the variability on block speed, but also increase how many batches will fit in a proof. We may decide to lengthen finality in order to reduce on-chain costs and lower transaction fees. _(At 556k gas to finalize, each finalize tx costs ~$9.80 as of June 3, 2024)._

### How does finality work without running a prover?

The Scroll SDK defaults to the behavior seen on Scroll Sepolia.

If proofs are not generated and accepted by the Coordinator, the Rollup Relayer with call a function on the L1 Bridge to finalize the state root without a proof. (This method is not part of the mainnet contracts.)

The default timeout for this finalization is 3600 seconds, to approximate mainnet finalization latency. To alter this behavior in Scroll SDK, set the following variables in `config.toml`:

```toml
TEST_ENV_MOCK_FINALIZE_ENABLED = true
TEST_ENV_MOCK_FINALIZE_TIMEOUT_SEC = 3600
```
